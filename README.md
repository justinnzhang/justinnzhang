# Hello! 👋

### My name is Justin Zhang, a Computer Science and Business graduate with a background in Design & Videography. 
I'll be starting as a Software Engineer at Realtor.com soon!

Previously, I've interned at **Meta** as a Technical PM, **Shopify** as a Software Engineer, and **The Royal Bank of Canada** as a Technical Systems Analyst!

My past work can be found on my [portfolio](https://justinzhang.ca/) - Feel free to reach out, I love to meet new people 😁
